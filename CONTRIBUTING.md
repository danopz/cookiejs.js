## How do I contribute code?

  Also make sure that no one else is already working on it. We don't want you to be
  disappointed.

2. Fork, then clone

3. Create a branch with a meaningful name for the issue: `git checkout -b add-something`

4. Make your changes and commit: `git add` and `git commit`

5. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-branch-name`

6. Submit a pull request to the upstream utilitiesjs repository.

7. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.

8. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, make changes if it's being recommended, and get it merged.

9. Hooray!
